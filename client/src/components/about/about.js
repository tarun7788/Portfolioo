            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, computers have held a special fascination for me.
            I wasn't just content with using them; I had a burning desire<br/> to understand how they worked, what made them tick.
            This insatiable curiosity naturally steered me towards the world of computer science.
            </p>

            <p>
            Today, my passion lies in development, problem-solving, and crafting technological solutions to real-world challenges.<br/>
            I'm constantly energized by exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date in the ever-evolving field.
            </p>
            Whether working collaboratively in a team or tackling projects solo, I thrive in both environments.<br/>
            I take ownership of my work, readily accept responsibility, and learn from my mistakes.<br/>
            As a team player, I believe my skills and enthusiasm would make me a valuable asset to any organization. <br/>
            I'm eager to contribute my knowledge, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities to a team that shares my passion for innovation.
